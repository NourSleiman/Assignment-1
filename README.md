# Assignment-1
I used the global spotify chart for the week ending Jan 23, 2020.
Output is written to the file "ArtistOutput.txt".
A 2D array is created first and the data is initially read into the array. Duplicate names are not added into the array. 
A linked list is created next and the elements in the 2D array are then inputted into the list. The elements are then sorted in ascending alphabetical order.
